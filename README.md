# Security+
I recently passed my Security+ (without any experience, with self-study, and a razzle-dazzle of procrastination). Since I don't want to lose the precious information I have learned why not add my notes somewhere it can be accessed easily? Plus, it will help me retain the information. In case you have come across this repo, feel free to edit it, make changes or just learn from it!

>I am no expert. I will be linking the videos and the chapters that I have referred to along with my own explanation. All the credits go to the respective authors. And of course, there is no profit involved in this little project.
